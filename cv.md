## About me
Currently studying in **BSU** at the **Applied Mathematics and Informatics** faculty. I haven't took any IT or english courses before,
so I'm planning to attend some in the future. At the moment I'm working as a site administrator and I believe
that it gives me "general" work expirienceand and helps to take my soft skills to another level. 
In the nearest future I'm planning to start working as a Junior JS Developer 
and I'm sure that i have enough determination to achieve this goal!
